Description:
In the modern financial industry, customer complaints play a crucial role in identifying areas where financial institutions can improve their services. Effectively categorizing these complaints into specific product categories, such as credit reports, student loans, or money transfers, is essential for addressing customer concerns promptly by routing the tickets to relevant personnel. Leveraging Generative AI for text classification can help financial institutions better understand customer grievances and respond more efficiently. Apart from this, a summary of the customer complaint helps the support personnel quickly grasp the gist of the grievance

Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to utilize Generative AI techniques to improve the classification and summarization of customer complaints in the financial sector.
Specifically, the project will focus on:

1. Text-to-Label Classification : Implementing Zero-shot and Few-shot prompting methods to accurately classify customer complaints into relevant product categories.
2. Text-to-Text Summarization : Using Zero-shot prompting to generate concise summaries of customer complaints, enabling more personalized and effective responses.

Conclusion:
Upon completing this project, you will have the capability to develop end-to-end applications for LLM-based text classification and summarization. These tools will enable financial institutions to automate the complaint handling process, leading to faster, more accurate responses to customer issues, improved customer satisfaction, and enhanced compliance with industry regulations. This project will also provide you with valuable skills and experience that can be applied to a range of real-world business challenges.
